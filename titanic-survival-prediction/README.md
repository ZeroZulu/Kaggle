# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic machine learning approach to predicting survival outcomes from the Titanic disaster dataset, originally provided by Kaggle. The goal is to understand key features affecting survival and build an interpretable prediction model.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is available on [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and includes the following:
- Passenger features like age, sex, class, and fare
- Binary target variable: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in survival
- Feature engineering for improved model performance
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Basic preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
- Model training with logistic regression and evaluation

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- **Survival distribution** by gender, class, and age
- **Correlation heatmap** of numerical features
- **Boxplots** and **countplots** for comparative insights
- Future idea: visualizing missing data with `missingno` or heatmaps

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data wrangling
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model training and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and exploration
