# 🎧 Beats & Bytes: Predictive Analytics for Spotify

**Type:** Data Science & Machine Learning Project  
**Tools:** Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📌 Overview

This project explores Spotify's song-level audio features and applies predictive modeling to classify and understand what makes a track **popular**.

> 💡 **Goal:** Use Spotify audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, tempo) to predict song popularity and gain insight into feature importance.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Perform feature exploration on Spotify track data
- Visualize distributions and relationships across audio features
- Build predictive models to classify a song as *popular* or *not*
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
- Share actionable insights from feature importance and correlation

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- 🎼 **EDA** on attributes like tempo, valence, loudness, and speechiness
- 🔗 **Correlation Analysis** showing which features link to popularity
- 🧠 **ML Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and others
- 📈 **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve
- 💡 **Feature Engineering** to simplify predictions and improve clarity
