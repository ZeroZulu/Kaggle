By combining rigorous data cleaning, insightful EDA, and advanced machine learning, we’ve uncovered patterns that can drive smarter business decisions. The predictive models offer a glimpse into the future, empowering Walmart to optimize operations and enhance customer satisfaction. As a data scientist, I’m excited to continue this journey, turning data into actionable impact.\n","\n","### **Key Takeaways**:\n","- **Seasonality**: Winter and holiday weeks are critical for revenue.\n","- **Store Variation**: Top stores can serve as benchmarks for others.\n","- **Predictive Power**: Advanced models like Random Forest provide reliable sales forecasts.\n","- **Next Steps**: Implement these insights into Walmart’s operations and explore additional features (e.g., promotional data) for even better predictions.\n","\n","-----\n","\n","* **Seasonality & Holidays Matter:**\n","    * Sales peaked consistently during the winter season and holiday weeks (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas), indicating a strong seasonal demand that can guide staffing and inventory decisions.\n","\n","* **Store-Level Variation:**\n","    * Some stores significantly outperformed others in average weekly sales. This opens opportunities for benchmarking, targeted marketing, and regional strategy optimization.\n","\n","* **Feature Correlations:**\n","    * Economic indicators like CPI and unemployment rate showed modest influence on weekly sales, while store ID, holiday flag, and month were stronger predictors.\n","\n","* **Holiday Weeks Drive Revenue:**\n","    * Sales during holiday weeks were 15–20% higher on average than during non-holiday weeks, emphasizing the importance of promotions and stock optimization during key retail periods.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":4438189,"sourceId":8620416,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31089,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.13"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":74.24872,"end_time":"2025-07-25T18:25:38.83765","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-07-25T18:24:24.58893","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
